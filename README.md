# .NET-Identity-Multitenant
This is an implementation of .NET identity which implements multitenancy. This repository is to be used as a template to further implement your own custom implementations of .NET identity without having to start from scratch. The implementation will implement .NET Clean Architecture to provide further separation of concerns.
